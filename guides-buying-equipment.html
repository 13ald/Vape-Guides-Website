            <p>
                When you are first getting started it can feel a little dawnting, I remember thinking <span
                    class="title-orange">"Where do I get
                    started?"</span><br>
                So this guide solves exactly that problem, you will know exactly what you need and exactly where to get
                it from.

            <h2 class="heading-text">What do I need to get <span class="title-orange">started</span>?</h2>
            <p>
            <H4><span class="title-orange">1. </span>Empty Bottles</H4>
            Empty bottles, now these are of course an absolute must. The size and shape of the bottles you use is
            entirely up to you, I would recommend at least having a stash of 10mls available for testing so that you
            don't end up wasting your ingredients on a recipe you don't like.
            </p><br><br>
            <p>
            <H4><span class="title-orange">2. </span>PG & VG</H4>
            As two of the key ingredients you will need when making any eliquid I would recommend getting both PG
            (propylene glycol) and VG (vegetable glycerin)
            instead of a base as this way it allows for more freedom to personalise your vaping experience. However if
            you are not sure about DIY in general this is still a good option to get yourself started.
            </p><br><br>
            <p>
            <H4><span class="title-orange">3. </span>Nicotine</H4>
            Nicotine, depending on where you live nicotine may be harder to come by in large quantities. Here in the UK
            for your average consumer it is only available in 10ml "Nic shots" so this will be the easiest way to get
            started as they are available from most vape retailers.
            If you are in the US or outside of EU TPD then you are subject to your own regions regulations, these do
            differ so you may need to research yourself before buying anything.
            </p><br><br>
            <p>
            <H4><span class="title-orange">4. </span>Flavourings</H4>
            Flavouring or flavour concentrates are available from select vaping DIY specialist retailers. There are many
            different brands of concentrate and they all have different tastes, 2 strawberries for example may taste
            completely different from each other from different brands. There are many different resources you can use
            to find out how they taste or would mix well with. We have a guide on this <a class="grid-links"

            <p>
            <H4><span class="title-orange">5. </span>Scales</H4>
            Scales, when mixing the easiest and most practical way to get the correct measurements is to weight
            everything out using a set of scales. So getting a set of scales that will do at least 500g of weight and
            are accurate to at least 2 decimal points is a requirement. The more accurate scales the, more accurate your
            mixes will be. These can be bought at Amazon in what ever region you are in.
            </p><br><br>
            <p>
            <H4><span class="title-orange">6. </span>Labels</H4>
            Labels, Now I know this doesn't sound like a necessity but they 100% are. These are great for keeping track
            of what is in your bottle, especially if you end up making a few different versions of the same profile. If
            you end up continuing down this path we recommend getting a label printer as it will make everything more
            uniform and easier to read. These are both also purchasable from Amazon.

                DIY vaping.<br><br>
